# Curriculum

I have decided on a very simple but direct website. Since it's supposed to be a "resume" of sorts, I want the information about who I am to come across and that I can be as direct as possible.

To do this, I have distributed the information in 6 sections. The profile picture with my name.  My studies, where I will mainly include my degree, which despite not being finished, are the knowledge I have taken from it that I would like to put into practice for the company that hires me. A small "about me" section, with a brief explanation. My skills, which are the ones I have acquired during the course, and I offer in the curriculum. The language, where I express my level in the different languages ​​I know how to speak. and finally a small contact section, separated from the rest of the sections (as it is the part they least need to see to make the decision to hire me) where there is my email and my telephone number (invented data, not real).

Finally, for the color palette, I looked for a pattern that matched white with light cold colors (of which I chose blue), with text in a darker color to make it stand out from the background. To make it nicer to look at, I put rounded corners, so it doesn't look so cut. And finally I have chosen a simple and formal typography.
